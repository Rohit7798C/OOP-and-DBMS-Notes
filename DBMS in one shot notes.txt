- Difference between DBMS and RDBMS
1) DBMS :- Stores data in unstructered way.
e.g:- Keeping books on a shelf in random manner.

2) RDBMS :- Stores data in pre-defined format like tables with rows and columns.
e.g:- Keeping books on a shelf in predefined structure, such that the books are related to each other.




DBMS - DataBase Management System
Database - Group of interrelated records stored in a proper organised form.
Management System - It is a software/system that manages the Database.

Adv:
1) Control data redundancy : Reduces the duplicate data.
2) Easily Maintenance.
3) Reduce time : It reduces the time for searching & sorting in Database.
4) Backup : Can keep copy/backup of data. 

SQL : Data is stored in tubular form. 
NoSQL : Data is stored in heirarchical form.

SQL(tubular form)

-****Attributes: The columns in the table are called attributes.
ROLL NO    DOB       AGE   NAME       MOBILE

1         12/04/2001  21   SHIVAM     999999999

2         06/12/1999  23   SOMU       888888888

3         04/02/2000  22   GOLU       777777777


-Types of Attributes:
1) Simple Attributes :- Attributes which cannot be further divided.
e.g :  AGE in above table

2) Composite Attributes :- Attributes which can be further divided.
e.g :  NAME in above table, NAME can be divided as First_Name & Last_Name.

3) Multi-Valued Attributes :- Attributes which can have multiple values (multiple values in a column).
e.g :  MOBILE in above table, a person can have multiple Mob Nos.

4) Derived Attributes :- Attributes which can be derived from other attributes.
e.g :  AGE can be derived from DOB in above table.

5) KEY Attributes :- Attributes which can be used to uniquely identify any row(It is a column having unique values).
e.g :  ROLL NO column in above table has unique values which can be used to uniquely identify data(record) of each row.




-****KEYS in SQL: Combination of attributes which can uniquely identify any record.

1) SUPER KEY: It is a combination of all the keys which can uniquely identify a record.
e.g. : Combining ROLL NO, DOB, AGE, NAME to get the MOBILE NO. in the above table.

2) CANDIDATE KEY:(Minimum number of attributes)Minimum Subset of SUPER KEY is called CANDIDATE KEY.
e.g. : Combining DOB, ROLL NO to get the MOBILE NO. in the above table.

3) PRIMARY KEY: One attribute from the set of attributes in Candidate key is called PRIMARY KEY.
e.g. : ROLL NO can be acted as PRIMARY KEY , because it can alone uniquely identify the data.

4) ALTERNATE KEY: CANDIDATE KEY other than the PRIMARY KEY is called ALTERNATE KEY.
e.g : DOB is the remaining one from CANDIDATE KEY so it will be the ALTERNATE KEY.

5) FOREIGN KEY: An Attribute in the current table which is a PRIMARY KEY in another table, is called FOREIGN KEY.
e.g. : IF MOBILE NO is an attribute in the current table, but is also a PRIMARY KEY in other table then it is called as FOREIGN KEY.



-****TYPES OF SQL COMMAND:
1) DDL-Data Definition Language. It works on the structure of the table.
- Shortcut : DR.CAT
- D-> DROP:- Delete the complete table.
- R-> RENAME:- Rename the table.
- C-> CREATE:- Create a table.
- A-> ALTER:- Add/delete the columns (Change the structure).
- T-> TRUNCATE:- Delete the data of the table.

2) DML- Data Manipulation Language. It works on the data of the table(Manipulate the data).
- Shortcut : DIU
- D-> DELETE:- Delete a Data.
- I-> INSERT:- Insert a Data.
- U-> UPDATE:- Update a Data.


3) DCL- Data Control Language. The access of data should be given to whom. Who can access the data.
- grant -> to give permission. 
- revoke -> to take permission.


4) TCL- Transaction Control Language.
- commit -> The output of the transaction should be visible in the database.
- Roll back -> return to the previous state.
- Savepoint -> The point at which Roll Back occurs.

5) DQL- Data Query Language
- SELECT


-****CONSTRAINTS IN SQL:
1) NOT NULL-> Data in that column cannot be null.
2) UNIQUE-> Data in that column should be unique.
3) PRIMARY KEY -> Data in that column can be uniquely identified based on that column.
4) FOREIGN KEY -> PRIMARY KEY of another TABLE.
5) CHECK -> Checking validation of every data, whether it is satisfying a particular condition.
   **CHECK is only used in CREATE TABLE so while creating the table it checks for the condition.


-****AGGREGATE FUNCTION:
1)COUNT()-> gives number of records.
2)SUM()-> If we apply SUM() on a particular column then it gives sum of all the records in that column.
3)AVG()-> Average of all the records in a particular column.
4)MIN()-> Minimum of all the records in a particular column.
5)MAX()-> Maximum of all the records in a particular column.


-****SQL QUERY TO FIND Nth HIGHEST SALARY

SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET(n-1);
->(n-1) means Skip the first (n-1) rows, for e.g. if we want 3rd highest salary then we would put n = 3 and skips the (3-1) rows, i.e. 1st and 2nd, to get the 3rd highest salary.
-> matlab which salary (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc).
->1 means pick only one data(salary).

-****CREATE COPY OF TABLE
1) Data with Schema -> create table new select * from old;
2) Only Schema -> create table new LIKE old;


-****PROPERTIES DEFINING THE CORRECTNESS OF DATA.
-ACID PROPERTIES:
1) ATOMICITY-> Transaction should be either successful or unsuccessful but not be middleware type(i.e. Atomic).
2) CONSISTENCY-> Data should be consistent(i.e. Updated).
3) ISOLATION-> Transactions running in parallel should be isolated from each other(Should not interrupt each other).
4) DURABILITY-> Transactions should be properly saved even if the system fails.



-****DATA INTEGRITY:
- Data integrity refers to the overall accuracy, completeness and reliability of data.
- Types of Data integrity:
1) DOMAIN Integrity:- Restricting the format, type, format and volume of data recorded in a database.
2) ENTITY Integrity:- The purpose is to ensure that data is not recorded multiple times.
3) REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY:- remove duplicate data records.
4) User defined INTEGRITY:- fulfill their specific requirements.


-****DIFFERE BETW****:
1) (DML command)DELETE :- we can delete one or more rows at a time(temporary delete, can be undo).
2) (DDL command)Truncate :- Deletes all the data at a time(permanently deleted) but the structure of the table remains same.
3) (DDL command)DROP :- Deletes the entire Structure of the table along with data (permanently deleted).


1) WHERE :- Applies condition on individual record.(e.g. WHERE marks>18).
2) HAVING :- Applies condition on group of records.


1) GROUP BY :- Grouping of data.
2) ORDER BY :- Ordering of data(ascending/descending)


1) CHAR :- Size is defined(fixed length).
2) VARCHAR :- Size is not defined(Variable length).


1) UNION :- Two tables are joined row-wise.
2) JOIN :- Two tables are joined column-wise.


1) IN :- Works as multiple ORs.(e.g. Delhi OR Mumbai Or Pune OR Nashik).
2) EXISTS :- Checks whether Record is present or not.(Returns True or False).


1) MINUS :- If A-B, then data of B common in A is removed from A.
2) INTERSECT :- Gives common data between two Tables.


1) UNION :- Combines all the data between two tables but excluding the duplicates.
2) UNION ALL :- Combines all the data between two tables but including the duplicates.




-****TYPES OF JOINS IN SQL****:
1) INNER JOIN :- Gives common data between the two tables.
2) LEFT(OUTER) JOIN :- Gives all the data from the left table including the common data between the two tables.
3) RIGHT(OUTER) JOIN :- Gives all the data from the right table including the common data between the two tables.
4) FULL(OUTER) JOIN :- Gives all the data from both tables including common data between the two tables.




-****NORMALISATION****:
- It is a technique to reduce REDUNDANCY(duplicacy) in a table.
- If there is REDUNDANCY(duplicacy) in table, then it leads to anamolies(problems) in INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
1) INSERT :- Inserting same data multiple times.
2) UPDATE :- updating data at multiple places.
3) DELETE :- Delete a data which has multiple copies.

- Types of NORMALISATION:
1) 1NF - No multi-value attribute.
2) 2NF - 1NF & No Partial Dependency.
3) 3NF - 2NF & No Transitive Dependency.
4) BNF - 3NF & LHS OF FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY MUST BE PART OF SUPER KEY.



-****PATTERN MATCHING****:
-"LIKE" clause is used for pattern matching task.
- "%" -> 0 or more character.
- "_" -> 1 character.


Q. Select name of Student whose name starts with 'pa';
Ans:- Select name from student where name like "pa%";

Q. Select name of student whose name starts with 'p' and contains 3 character in name;
Ans:- Select name from student where name like "p_ _ _";


-****CHARACTER MANIPULATION FUNCTION****
1)Upper():-> Makes the entire Column data in capital.
2)Lower():-> Makes the entire Column data in small.
3)Initcap():-> Makes the first Letter capital.
4)Length():-> Finds the length of string capital.
5)Concat():-> Combines the data from two columns in the table(e.g. Name + Surname).



-****VIEW****:
- A view is a Virtual table based on the result set of an sql statement.
- A person can take a part of data in the form of view, and can perform required operations on it, without disturbing the entire data.
- Syntax: 
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, FROM student WHERE condition.....
- e.g.- CREATE VIEW abc AS
        SELECT name, roll_no, FROM student WHERE name="ROHIT";
